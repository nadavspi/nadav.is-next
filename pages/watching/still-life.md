Oh, I liked this a lot; The setting is stunning, the style is contemplative, the background is interesting.

The is set in Fengjie while it was being demolished and flooded to allow for the construction of the [Three Gorges Dam 三峡大坝](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chinas-three-gorges-dam-disaster/). The project [displaced more than a million people](https://www.hrw.org/legacy/summaries/s.china952.html) who were resettled by the government and given payment, as well as [a yearly allotment of grain based on how much land they lost](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-07/15/content_348413.htm).
