Most popular Chinese drama of the year, I believe.

I enjoyed a lot of it, but dropped it towards the end when every third sentence started to be about how [Education and Rectification](https://www.thechinastory.org/xis-2021-political-legal-rectification-campaign/) is getting rid of what little evil remains in society. Unfortunately for the propogandists, the gangster is just too compelling.
